# What is Movex?

Movex is a Multiplayer (Game) State Synchronization Library using Deterministic Action Propagation without the need to write Server Specific Code.

# Why another state management framework?

Movex combines the following features out of the box:

1. Local and Remote State Synchronization across all peers and server.
2. Server Authoritative with Deterministic Propagation. Why is that important? Read [here](https://gafferongames.com/post/deterministic_lockstep/) or [here](https://longwelwind.net/blog/networking-turn-based-game/).
3. Secret/Private State Fragments.
4. Easy, functional way to handle the stateÂ via Actions & Reducers.
5. Write only client code. (The server code and multiplayer mode is incidental)!!! ðŸ¥³

# Interesting! How does it work?

At its core Movex is a local Redux/Flux-like store that incidentally synchronizes the state with all the peers involved as well as with the Server (Master). Without having to write any specific code for that or for the Server!

There are a few key concepts to know:

2. [Reducers](/overview/reducers)
3. [Actions](/overview/actions)
4. [State & Private State Fragments](/overview/state)

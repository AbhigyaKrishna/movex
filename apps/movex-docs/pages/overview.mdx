# What is Movex?

Movex is a "predictable state container for Javascript Apps", just like it's main inspiration – Redux, but built for applications where the state needs to be shared accross multi-players or multi-peers in a network, just like a turn-based game, a chat application, or anything in between. 

Oh, and there is no need to worry about Server Code or Server Deployments. Really! You just just write client code using any of the Javascript frameworks or game engines, and Movex will takes care of the server code incidentally. See more on how [here](/how)!

Movex combines the following features out of the box:

1. [Authoritative Server w/o Server Code](/overview/server_authoritative)
2. [Realtime Staet Sync](/overview/realtime).
3. [Secret State](/overview/secret_state).
4. [Easy, functional way to handle the state via Actions & Reducers](/overview/functional).

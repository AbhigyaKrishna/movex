# How does Movex work

Movex relies heavily on the concept of "Purity" and the "Deterministic Propagation Method", described in more detail [here](/docs/features/functional) to work under the hood.

import { MovexDiagram } from '../../components/MovexDiagram';

<br/>
<br/>
<MovexDiagram />
<br/>
<br/>

See the following concepts to understand how each play a vital role in building with Movex:

1. [Resources](/docs/how/resources)
2. [Reducers](/docs/how/reducers)
3. [Actions](/docs/how/actions)
4. [State](/docs/how/state)
5. [Secret State](/docs/how/secret_state)
6. [State Synchronization](/docs/how/state_synchronization).

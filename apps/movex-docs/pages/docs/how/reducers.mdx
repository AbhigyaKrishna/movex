# Reducers

Each Resource, needs a Reducer to modify its state. A Movex Reducer, is almost the same as a Redux or React's useReducer' reducer. It's where the business/game logic happens. [Learn more here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/redux/redux_reducers.htm) on what a reducer does in Redux.

Example of a reducer:

```ts
// *Api might change

import { Action } from 'movex';

export type CounterState = {
  count: number;
};

export const initialCounterState: CounterState = {
  count: 0,
};

export type CounterActions =
  | Action<'increment'>
  | Action<'decrement'>
  | Action<'incrementBy', number>;

export default (state = initialCounterState, action: CounterActions) => {
  if (action.type === 'increment') {
    return {
      ...state,
      count: state.count + 1,
    };
  }

  if (action.type === 'decrement') {
    return {
      ...state,
      count: state.count - 1,
    };
  }

  if (action.type === 'incrementBy') {
    return {
      ...state,
      count: state.count + action.payload,
    };
  }

  return state;
};
```

It's a simple, deterministic mechanism that when given the same input, it always returns the same output.

Where it differs from Redux is that it runs both on the Client and the Server, which makes such features as **Server Authority** and **Private States** possible.

# Secret State

Sometimes, some parts of the state need not be known by every peer subscribed to the state right away. This is called Secret State or Secret State Fragments.

Think about Poker game for example where, each player gets a pair of cards that are meant to be kept **_secret_** until the end of the round. In a naive implementation of a Shared State setup, all of the drawn cards would be available and thus accessible somewhere in the global state – and a bad actor would be able to read their values, event hough the actual cards might be hidden in the UI.

Movex makes it very obfuscate Secret State from the get-go by taking the route of filtering out such state from the reach of a peer client. It manages this by making use of [Private Actions](/docs/how/secret_state#private-actions) and [Reconciliatory Checks](/docs/how/secret_state#reconciliatory-checks).

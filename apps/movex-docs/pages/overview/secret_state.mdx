# Secret State

Sometimes, some parts of the state need not be known by every peer subscribed to the state right away. This is called Secret State or Secret State Fragments. 

This about a Poker game for example where, each player gets a pair of cards that are meant to be kept Secret until the end of the round. In a naive implementation of a Shared State setup, all of the drawn cards would be available somewhere in the global state – and a bad actor, without much skill would be able read eventhough the actual cards might be hidden in the UI.

Movex makes it very simple to work with Secret State, out of the box, by making use of Private Actions and Reconciliation Checks.

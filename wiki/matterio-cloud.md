# Matterio Cloud

The Saas built on top of Matterio offering, the following features for a paid subscription:
- [ ] hosting
- [ ] out of the box analytics
- [ ] ease of deployments (ala vercel with next using github/gitlab integrations)

This will pair @matterio/server with the Matterio Store (Redis). In the future it could even offer persistence, identity and other out of the box as well, but for the moment is just a wrapper around @matterio/server that pairs with the store.

## Marketing[marketing]

### Landing Page[landing-page]
- [ ] Using Framer 

- [ ] Bright colors on a purpleish backrdound. Brilliant pink, green, blue/cyan.

- [ ] For the Landing page I'm thinking to showcase a bunch of games right in the page, like a different section. Would be pretty cool if people get to play them right there, and to have the whole pipeline, go through a different country or so show on the other screen (all iframes) and present how it all works with the actions and stuff.

- [ ] Also I'm thinking to take some premade sample games in other engines such as phaser or whatnot and add matterio to them to showcase the ease

### Collect Interest[collect-interest]
  - Emails from the landing page
  - People on reddit

## Launch

- [ ] Javascript Weekly
- [ ] Product Hunt

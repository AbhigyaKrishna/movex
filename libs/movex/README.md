## 🧐 Why Movex

__Movex let's you cut the development time in half and ship 10x faster, by abstracting the backend and server-side away! 🎉__

With it's unique approach and set of features Movex gives you the freedom to focus only on the front-end while still maintaining all of the control over the App Logic, UI/UX and Authority over Data.

In addition it comes pre-packed with the ability to keep parts of the shared state private to specific users ([See Secret State](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/secret_state)), ensures the minimun amount of data is sent over the wire with each update ([See Deterministic Action Propagation](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/functional)) and keeps bad actors away by keeping the Data Reconciliation Logic out of the client reach ([See Authoritative Server](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/server_authoritative))!
